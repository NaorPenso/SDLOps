## Reporting issues & features requests

If you notice any bugs in the app, see some code that can be improved, or have features you would like to be added, please create a [bug report](https://github.com/SPLOps/SPLOps/issues/new?template=BUG_REPORT.md) or a [feature request](https://github.com/SPLOps/SPLOps/issues/new?template=FEATURE_REQUEST.md)!
