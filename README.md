Since the SDLC inception by Microsoft in 2008, the development world has undergone multiple transformations with extensive impact on the methods products are being designed, developed and operationalized. Those changes, including most noticably the Agile transformation and "everything as code" rendered the SDLC process irrelevant.

None the less, those transformations presents an opportunity for security teams to embed their practices and requirements into the product and business practices and help promote better and more secure development practices from the get-go ("shift left") and furthremore, even enahnce production security through the understanding of the product ecosystem and its components.

SPL{ops} (Secure Product Lifecycle Operations) aims to create a framework for security and product teams to adopt while leveraging Agile and "as code" lifestyles to enhance the security of the product whilst reducing the friction between the teams and the core of all security issues -> being too late to the party. 


## Features

A few of the things you can do with SDL{ops}:

* Kickstart product security, for anyone from startups to enterprises
* Find a purpose built framework for implementing "SDLC" for Agile & Ops Driven teams
* Get a curated list of opensource and commerical solutions that can fit into the framework
* Access child projects that extends the framework into the techical realms and help drive product security forward
